# Java-Trie

Implementation of the Trie data structure in Java

Run the 'tester' program to ensure that the structure functions properly

This implementation of the trie data structure takes in key-value pairs in a
hashmap with the key equal to the final letter of the word and the value equal
to the word itself.

To add a word, you must use the add method and add the word as both the key and
the value.
